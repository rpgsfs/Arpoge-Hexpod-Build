    <!--Capture site conditions and field data with ease. Simply take a photo of buildings, structures, or objects you need to measure. The BLK3D combines traditional methods of documenting site conditions into a digital, simple-to-use device thatâ€™s
    faster, easier, more collaborative, and much more detailed than traditional measuring and field data documentation. Share images that contain 3D measurements and dimensions to anyone on your team straight from the BLK3D or your computer.-->
