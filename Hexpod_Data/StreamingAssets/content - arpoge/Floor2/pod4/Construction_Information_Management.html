    <!--RPG provides program management to the construction industry through the application of knowledge, skills, tools and techniques to coordinate and control the complex range of activities to meet an overall program's requirements. We use BIM to
    extract quantities of work to prepare cost estimates. Moreover, schedule integrated BIM known as 4D BIM can be used for animations, safety analysis, prepare site logistic plans, and coordinate work with subcontractors.-->
