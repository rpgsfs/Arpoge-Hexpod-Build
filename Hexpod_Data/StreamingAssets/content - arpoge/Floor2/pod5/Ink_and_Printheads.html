      <!--Ink and Printheads are the key to hassle-free printing.. Whether you are printing detailed drawings or high definition photos, HP Ink delivers the expert quality, consistent results you require. While non-HP inks may cost less per liter, they
      often cause frequent printhead replacement and unpredictable prints. Using original HP Ink cartridges in your HP DesignJet and PageWide XL equipment is the key to insuring top performance and reliability. RPG provides a large selection of ink
      and toner cartridges to suit your equipment and needs. -->
