      <!--Choose an RPGâ€™s Comprehensive Supply Plan to prevent a disrupted workflow and keep your equipment well stocked. These plans provide straightforward, fixed pricing on all inks, printheads, bond media, service, parts, and labor based on actual
      usage for your large format printers and plotters. In a busy office environment, it can be easy to lose track of your supply stock. Unexpectedly running out of ink and media can stall productivity. Choose the right Comprehensive plan for your
      printing volume needs and keep your office running smoothly. -->
